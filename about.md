         #### Correspondence seminars
         I was ensnared by physics as soon as at the elementary school, it had grown into my head and we are living in a happy symbiosis ever since. It's all fault of correspondence seminars <a href="http://www.p-mat.sk/aktivity/pikomat-pikofyz/" target='_blank'>Pikomat and Pikofyz</a>. For those who don't know, they are math and physics competitions organised by enthusiastic volunteers for talented kids. They regularly organize week longs camps for best problem solvers, and when I finally got to one and met all those great people, my path in life was set. I started to participate in all kind of scientific competitions (FKS, KMS, Physics olympiad, Slovak Young Physics Tournament,...) and later at secondary school I became involved in their organising as a volunteer. It all culminated with a silver medal at International Physics Olympiad and a decision to study physics at the university. This whole life period has given me a lot. I found out what a joy of thinking is, learned how to solve difficult problems and got to knew a lot of inspirational people. Furthermore, as a volunteer at Pikofyz I am a veteran of many summercamps. There I learned how to learn, how to cooperate with a great team ( and what a great team even looks like) as well as how to keep the attention of a horde of uncontrolable children. And who can handle a horde of kids can handle anything.
         
         #### Mountains
         I have been spending time in nature (often in High Tatras) with my family since I was little and since the time my parents found a climbing gym in our town, it went uphill with me. Mountains are still my favourite place to spend my free time in, be it hiking or rockclimbing. Since 2014, I am a member of <a href="http://hkfilozof.sk" target='_blank'>Alpine club Philosopher</a> in Bratislava and although climbing isn't the only sport I ever tried (I did for example also parkour or jumping on trampolines), it is definitely my favourite one.

         I like adventure and deep thought. I like sci-fy and fantasy: Dune, Malazan Book of the Fallen, Asimov, Discworld series, Harry Potter and Methods of Ratianlity, War of the Worlds (fight with aliens from the pen of author who lived in the era of steam engines is absolutely magical). I like music: W.A.S.P., Led Zeppelin, Omnia, John Butler, Čechomor, Nohavica. I like good people. I like puzzle hunts, slackline, larps (although I don't attend them anymore) and mountains. I like quantum mechanics, Fermi's estimates and coding in Python. I like webcomics: xkcd, Gunnerkrig Court, SMBC, Order of the Stick. I like silly questions with serious answers and serious questions with silly answers. Oh, and I like <a href="https://bonvivani.sk/recepty/tvarohovy-kolac-s-hrozienkami" target="_blank">curd cake</a>. I love curd cake.
