     title: 'What I like'
     content: |
         *  I like sci-fi and fantasy: Dune, Malazan Book of the Fallen, Asimov, Discworld series, Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality, War of the Worlds (fight with the aliens from the pen of an author who lived in the era of steam engines is absolutely magical). I like music: W.A.S.P., Led Zeppelin, Omnia, John Butler, Čechomor, Nohavica. I like good people. I like puzzle hunts, slackline and mountains. I like quantum mechanics, Fermi's estimates and coding in Python. I like webcomics: xkcd, Gunnerkrig Court, SMBC, Order of the Stick. I like silly questions with serious answers and serious questions with silly answers. And <a href="/curd-cake" target="_blank">curd cake</a>.

     content: |
         * I have masters degree in solid states physics at Commenius University, Bratislava. The topic of my diploma thesis was superconducting quantum bits.
         * I have three years of experience as machine learning engineer in multiple startups (Merlon, HealthMode)
             * Bayesian inference (pymc3), neural networks (Torch, Tensorflow)
             * Python (Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib)
             * Clojure
         * I have long experience as volunteer organising correspondence competitions in math and physics for children (<a href="https://pikomat.sk/">Pikomat</a> and <a href="https://pikofyz.sk/">Pikofyz</a>).
             * Formulation of problem questions, coordination of volunteers, giving lectures, supervising at summer camps

Welcome to my personal page. I am Ján Bogár. Forever curious, scientist at heart, a bit of an adventurer. I like old sci-fi, deep ideas, in my free time I rockclimb.
This page contains my <a href="/blog_en">blog</a> and a few things about me.
