This is my mum's recipe for a wonderfully tasty curd pie. It goes like this:

First we make the dough. We will need:

 - 30 dkg of smooth flour
 - 12-14 dkg of butter
 - 2 spoons of sugar powder
 - 4 egg yolks
 - 0,5 dl of milk
 - 1 pack of yeast
 
We mix the flour, butter, sugar, yolks and bloomed yeast (mix lukewarm milk, sugar and yeast and let it rest in a warm place for about 10 minutes) and work it into the dough. We divide it into halves, roll out the first one and lay it on the greesed and floured baking pan.

Than we make the filling. We will need:

 - 1 kg of curd
 - 2 vanilla sugars
 - 8 spoons of sugar powder
 - 1 spoon of special flour
 - 4 egg whites
 - 1 pack of raisins

We mix everything together and put it on the pan. Than we will roll out the second half of the dough and lay it on top of the filling. We let the pie rise for an hour, than we pierce the upper layer of the dough on a few places and than we bake it in the oven. Afterwards we dust it with the sugar powder and finally we eat it. Bon apetit!
